.. warning::
    This website is an unofficial prototype.

This is the website for PV Atlas, a project led by the
PV Performance Modeling Collaborative (`PVPMC <http://pvpmc.sandia.gov>`_).
PV Atlas characterizes the effect of climate and geography on
various aspects of photovoltaic (PV) performance modeling and analysis.
PV Atlas uses scalable open-source PV performance models and
high-resolution gridded weather and irradiance datasets.
