About PV Atlas
==============

.. warning::
    This website is an unofficial prototype.

This is the website for PV Atlas, a project led by the
PV Performance Modeling Collaborative (`PVPMC <http://pvpmc.sandia.gov>`_).

PV Atlas investigates the effect of climate and geography on
various aspects of photovoltaic (PV) performance modeling and analysis.
For example, how does climate affect the optimal tilt angle
for a PV array?  Does the energy gain from antireflective coating
vary regionally?  What geographic patterns exist in interannual
solar resource variability?  By applying scalable PV performance modeling tools to
gridded weather and irradiance datasets,  PV Atlas can perform detailed simulation
case studies to answer these kinds of questions.  

For example, here is a heatmap showing the number of years of data needed
to achieve a given level of certainty in performance loss rate estimates
